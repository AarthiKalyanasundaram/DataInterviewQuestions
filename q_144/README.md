# Formatting dirty data (continued)

Suppose you have the following [data set](../q_143/dataset/grocery_shopping.xlsx) which contains (1) a list of items purchased by a given user, (2) a mapping that for item id's to the item name and price, (3) a matrix that formats data from sheet 1 into a matrix with users in rows and the number of each item_id purchased.

Given these 3 data sets, can you create a list of users who have spent the most?
