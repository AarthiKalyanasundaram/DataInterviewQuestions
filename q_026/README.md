# Is red independent from an ace? (another card problem)
Is drawing a red card and drawing an ace independent? You can read more about a
standard card deck [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck).
Hint: Drawing an ace (event A) and drawing a red card (event B) are two separate
events -- think of a way to prove (using probability theory) that knowing whether
event A occurred impacts the probability of event B occuring.
