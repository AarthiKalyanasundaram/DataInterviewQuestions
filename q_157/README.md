# Company acquisitions

You work for a conglomerate that is constantly acquiring new companies. You're working with the human resource team to understand how many new employees you're taking on. Each of the companies you are acquiring, has the following organization structure.

You can assume that you have all this information in the following table:

**Table:** allCompanyEmployees

| chief_executive_officer | vice_president | director | manager | individual_contributor | company_code |
|-------------------------|----------------|----------|---------|------------------------|--------------|
| johnny | tammy | lenny | penny | jim | abc |
| johnny | tammy | lenny | penny | tim | abc |
| johnny | tammy | lenny | penny | pam | abc |
| michael | pam | jerry | jimmy | timmy | def |

You can also assume that the instead of names in the table, you have employee IDs (for uniqueness). Given the table, can you write a query to print the company_code, CEO name (or ID), total number of vice presidents, total number of directors, total number of managers, and total number of individual contriubtors.
