# Check whether two arrays are equal

Given two arrays, write a function in vanilla python (e.g., no libraries) to check whether or not the arrays are equal. You can consider the two arrays equal if both of them contain same set of elements - the order of elements can differ. 

For example, given the following: 

```python
arr1 = [1,5,6,7,8,0]        
arr2 = [0,5,7,6,8,1]
```

output = Yes 

```python
arr3 = [1,5,6,7,8,0]        
arr4 = [0,7,7,7,8,1]
```

output = No
