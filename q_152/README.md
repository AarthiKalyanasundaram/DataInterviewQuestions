# Clustering function

Suppose you have the following data set which contains (1) a list of items purchased by a given user and (2) a mapping that for item id's to the item name and price (ignore sheet 3).

With this data, we want to see if we can cluster types of groceries that are typically purchased together. In a previous question, for this data set, we wanted to build plots to look at n=3, 5, and 7. Knowing this, can you create a function that allows us to input the number of clusters and returns a plot?
