# Smallest, unrepresented integer

Given a sorted (sorted in non-decreasing order) array of positive numbers, can you find the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented as a sum of elements from the array?

```bash
Input:  arr[] = {1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 15};
Output: 2
```

```bash
Input:  arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1};
Output: 5
```

```bash
Input:  arr[] = {1, 1, 3, 4};
Output: 10
```
