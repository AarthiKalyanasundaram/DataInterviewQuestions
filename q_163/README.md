# Counting the distance between words in Python

Suppose you are given two words, word_1 and word_2 as well as a string containing them, called your_string. Given this, write a function using Python to find the minimum distance between word_1 and word_2. For the context of this question, distance is defined as the number of words between word_1 and word_2.

For example, given the following: 

Input : your_string = “the quick rabbit ran through the field with a carrot”, word_1 = “quick”, word_2 = “field” 

Output : 4 

Here there are 4 words between "rabbit" and "field" in our string.
