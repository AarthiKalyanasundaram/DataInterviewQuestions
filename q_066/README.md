# Matrix frequencies

Given a matrix of order m*n then the task is to find the frequency of even and odd numbers in matrix.

For example, given the following inputs:

```python
m = 2, n = 3 
[[ 9, 11, 3 ], 
[ 4, 12, 2 ]] 
```

Your function should return the following output: 
  * Frequency of odd #: 3 
  * Frequency of even #: 3
