# Counting numbers, letters, and other things from a text file

Write a function that can take in a text file and return the number of characters in the file that are alphabetic, numeric, or other non space characters. The input to the function will be the string location of the text file (assume that this location string will pull up the text file).

For a hint, see this [webpage](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html).
