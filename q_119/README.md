# Chipotle item analysis (part 2)

Suppose you are given a data set of [Chipotle orders](./dataset/chipotle.tsv). Using these data, can you make a plot showing total revenue per menu item? The solution will be written in Python code, walking through the logic/calculation. 

Note, you'll probably want to classify the menu items into categories, or you'll have a very long list.
