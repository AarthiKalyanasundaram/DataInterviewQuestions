# Car Battery

A given car has a number of miles it can run before its battery is depleted, where the number of miles are exponentially distributed, with an average of 10,000 miles to depletion. If a given individual needs to make a trip that's 3,000 miles, what is the probability that she/he will be able to complete the trip without having to replace the battery? You can assume the car battery is new for this problem.
