# Alternative array sorting

Given an array of integers, print the array in alternating min/max order. The
first element should be the first maximum, second element should be the first
minimum, third element should be second maximum, etc.

For example, given the following array:

```python
arr[] = [10, 2, 11, 3, 7, 4, 1]
```

Your function should return:

```python
11, 1, 10, 2, 7, 3, 4
```
