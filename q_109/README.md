# Weather forecasting, a Markov Chain problem

In a particular area, there are 2 types of weather: sunny and rainy. The following is observed across a couple year period.

  * The probability of weather staying sunny the following week is 80%.
  * The probability of the weather changing from sunny to rainy is 20%.
  * The probability of the weather staying rainy from the following week is 70%.
  * The probability of weather changing from rainy to sunny over a week is 30%.

Given this information, can you create a transition matrix and calculate the steady state vector?

If you need a refresher, here is a resource on [Markov Chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).
