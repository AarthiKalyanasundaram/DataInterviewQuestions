# Histogram of years worked

Given [this file](dataset/dete-exit-survey-january-2014.csv), can you create a cumulative distribution chart of the total years worked across all employees surveyed? You can exclude values that indicate the employee did not state his/her start or end date. Some notes:

Question 103 will help you convert the Cease Date into a standard format

Total years worked = Cease Date Year - DETE Start Date Year
