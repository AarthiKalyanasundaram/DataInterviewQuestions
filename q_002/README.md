# Calculating a moving average using python

You are given a list of numbers J and a single number p.

Write a function to return the minimum and maximum averages of the sequences of p numbers in J. 
Example:

```bash
   J = [4, 4, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12]

   p = 3
```

The sequences will be:

```bash
    (4,4,4)

    (4,4,9)

    (4,9,10)

    (9,10,11)

    (10,11,12)
```

Minimum average will be 4 and the maximum average will be 11, which corresponds to the first and last sequences.
