# Multiply array values, return the remainder

Given an array of varying length containing multiple #s, and a number x. Write a short program in python find the remainder of the array multiplication divided by x. For example, given the following: 

```bash
array = [5,2,4,1,5] 
x = 6 
```

We would calculate output as such:
```bash
52415 = 200 % 6 = 2
```
