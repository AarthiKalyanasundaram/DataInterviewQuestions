# Middle matrix sums

Given an integer matrix, m, with odd # dimensions, n x n, (e.g 3 x 3, 5 x 5, etc), find the sum of middle row as well as the middle column.

For example, given:

```bash
[1,2,3] 
[4,5,6] 
[7,8,9]
```

Your program would output:
  * Sum middle row = 15 (e.g. 4+5+6) 
  * Sum middle column = 15 (e.g. 2+5+8)
