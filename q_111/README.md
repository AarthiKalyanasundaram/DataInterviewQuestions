# Filtering student information with Pandas, revisited

Suppose you have a dataframe, df, with the following records:

| Age | Favorite Color | Grade | Name |
|-----|----------------|-------|------|
| 20 | blue | 88 | Willard Morris |
| 19 | blue | 95 | Al Jennings |
| 22 | yellow | 92 | Omar Mullins |
| 21 | green | 70 | Spencer McDaniel |

The dataframe is showing information about students. Write code using Python Pandas to select the rows where the students' favorite color is green or yellow and their grade is between 85-95 (inclusive).
