# Leader life expectancy

Suppose you have the following [data set](./dataset/Archigos.csv) which is a list of leaders for all independent states in the world as outlined in the Gleditsch and Ward. 

With this data, for all leaders that have valid birth and death years, can you plot the life expectancy over time for these leaders? Hint: I would probably do a box and whisker plot to show distributions over time.
