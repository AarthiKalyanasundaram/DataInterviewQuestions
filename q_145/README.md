# Similarity Matrix and Heat Chart

Suppose you have the following [data set](../q_143/dataset/grocery_shopping.xlsx) which contains (1) a list of items purchased by a given user, (2) a mapping that for item id's to the item name and price, (3) a matrix that formats data from sheet 1 into a matrix with users in rows and the number of each item_id purchased.

Using this data, can you create a similarity matrix for each item? Then can you create a heat chart that visually displays the similarity matrix?

Note: The purpose of doing this exercise is to explore ways of analyzing data that could be generalized by a group (think clustering). This data set will be used in a couple of future questions that continue to explore clustering data.
