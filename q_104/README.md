# Termination survey data

Given this [table](dataset/dete-exit-survey-january-2014.csv) here, can you write a SQL query to pull the average and median time bewteen (1) "Role Start Date" and "DETE Start Date" and (2) "Role Start Date" and "Cease Date" by position. For this exercise, you can replace the spaces with underscores for the field names and we can name the table TerminationSurvey. If there's a "Not Started" in the date data, you can exclude it.
