# Pythagorean triplet

Given an array of integers, can you write a function that returns "True" if there is a triplet (a, b, c) within the array that satisfies a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

Examples: 

```bash
Input: arr[] = {3, 1, 4, 6, 5} 
Output: True 
```

There is a Pythagorean triplet (3, 4, 5) that exists in the input array.

```bash
Input: arr[] = {10, 4, 6, 12, 5} 
Output: False 
```

There is no Pythagorean triplet that exists in the input array.
